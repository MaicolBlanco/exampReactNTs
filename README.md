React Native + TypeScript + Expo

# My Comments: Maicol Blanco
This Project is for testing and getting to know React Native with TypeScript
I start with basic, but elementary things.

## Installation
We validate if we have node installed

```bash
node -v
```
If we have to install node [node](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).

- We create the app with the Expo and use TypeScript [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/).

```terminal
npx create-expo-app -t expo-template-blank-typescript
```
- Choose the name of your application

Move to the application
```
cd AppName/
```

check your version
``` 
expo --version
```

Initialize the application
```
npx expo start
```
And use 'Ctrl' to go back
