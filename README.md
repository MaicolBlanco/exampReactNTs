React Native + TypeScript + Expo

# My Comments: Maicol Blanco
This Project is for testing and getting to know React Native with TypeScript
I start with basic, but elementary things.

## Installation
We validate if we have node installed

```bash
node -v
```
If we have to install node [node](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup).
